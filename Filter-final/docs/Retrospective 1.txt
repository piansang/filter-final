Retrospective

We’ve been able to successfully create the app. We’ve come to the conclusion that we need to improve the way we communicate better.

We’re creating a group chat to make sure we have another way to reach group members if they become unresponsive.

We’re going set deadlines on Trello to make sure we hold each other accountable.

We’re established a single person, to manage our boards on Trello so that we can break up roles better.
