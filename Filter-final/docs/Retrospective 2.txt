Retrospective

We've again succesfully implementated the major features we wanted for this iteration of the app.

However we've found that some of the issues that arose during our last sprint are still present.

We still need to improve our communication but we have made strides and are communicating more.

We are doing a better job of using trello and going forward will use it to be very clear about what's being done and by who.

We're going to start working on things much sooner and delagating work more efficiently and effectively.
